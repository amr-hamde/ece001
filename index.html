  Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence inmachines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The<br/>
  term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with ahuman mind such as learning and problem-solving.<br/>
  The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and takeactions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of<br/>
  artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept thatcomputer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without<br/>
  being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this automaticlearning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as<br/>
  text, images, or video.<br/>
   <br/>
            
  When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usuallythink of is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories<br/>
  about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could befurther from the truth.<br/>
  Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks,<br/>
  from themost simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial<br/>
  intelligence include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers anddevelopers in the field are making surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities<br/>
  such as learning, reasoning, and perception, to the extent that these can beconcretely defined. Some believe that innovators may soon be able to develop<br/>
  systems that exceed the capacity of humans to learn or reason out any subject.But others remain skeptical because all cognitive activity is laced with value<br/>
  judgments that are subject to human experience.As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence<br/>
  become outdated. For example, machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optical character recognition are no longer considered<br/>
  toembody artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function.<br/>
  AI is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines are wired using a cross-disciplinary approach based on mathematics, computer<br/>
  science, linguistics, psychology, and more.<br/>
